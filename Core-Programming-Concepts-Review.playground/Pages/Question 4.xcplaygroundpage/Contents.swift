 # Question 4
 
 Imagine you are creating an app to track food usage in the LCS Dining Hall to help reduce food waste.
 
 The kitchen staff and TOD will use your app to track the following information:
 
 * Diners: the total number of people who ate at a single meal
 * Salad bar: the total quantity of salad bar items consumed by mass (in kilograms)
 * Soup: the total volume of soup consumed by mass (in litres)
 * Main course: the total mass of main course (hot items) consumed by mass (in kilograms)
 * Pizza oven: the total mass of items consumed that were made in the pizza oven, by mass (in kilograms)
 * Date: The date of the meal (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 * Time frame: The time frame of the meal (e.g.: 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM)
 
 Declare constants for each of these items, **but be sure to choose the appropriate data type in each case**.
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for each constant.

// Answer question 4 below
var diners : Int
print ("the tolta number of people is integer")

var dinerCount : Int = 4
print ("an integer is used for dinercount becasue you really cannot have half or a quarter of a person" )


var sladber : Double
var soup : Double
var maincourse : Double
var pizzaoven : Double
print ("A dubble- lercision floating print value (a Dubble) is used for the above four variables because these measurements could very well have part of a whole (for example, 3.4 kg of salad")


var date : String = "Thursday, January 18, 2018"
var timeframe : String = "11:30 AM to 1:00 PM"
print ("A String is used for these variables because you cannot store a mix of characters and numbers in any other data type")

 ### Learning Goals - Programming
 
 * Goal 2
    * *Thinking*
        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.
